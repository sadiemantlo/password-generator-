# Password Generator 

## **Description** 

This application is a random password generator. I started with starter code of basic HTML and CSS that was the main skeleton of the page but was not interactive aside from having a non-working button. I added JavaScript code in order to make the page interactive and capable of receiving user input to later be used. 

## **Installation**

N/A

## **Usage**

To use this application the user must click on the red button that reads "Generate Password". Once the generate password is clicked, a prompt appears that asks the user to type the amount of characters they would like to use (must be between 8-128). After the character amount is selected, a series of prompts appear asking if the user would like to use uppercase, lowercase, numeric and special characters. The user selects yes or no by clicking either clicking "OK" or "Cancel". Once the user has answered all of the prompts, a randomly generated password will appear on the screen in the designated box.
